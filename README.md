# TwinBridge

TwinBridge builds digital-twin models that support synthetic control arms and prognosis in neurodegenerative disease, while explicitly quantifying when results are reliable under shift, bias, and uncertainty. Our focus is decision readiness: clear conditions for when evidence is strong enough to act, and when it is not.

We pair with pharma teams, hospitals, and natural history data companies to develop drug-specific solutions. The goal is to reduce control-arm burden responsibly, with safeguards that keep claims within validated support.

## What we do

- Natural-history twins for trajectories and time-to-event endpoints
- Synthetic controls to augment placebo arms when acceptability gates are met
- Decision-readiness safeguards: overlap, calibration, and causal plausibility

## Disease focus

- ALS: rapid progression and heterogeneous trajectories
- Dementia: long course with transportability challenges
- Parkinson's: slow progression needing longitudinal modeling
